-- First, let's see what specific operations the service_role needs for profiles
-- Based on the edge functions, it needs to:
-- 1. Read profiles for notifications (to get user info)
-- 2. Create profiles during user registration (handle_new_user trigger)
-- 3. Update profiles for account linking scenarios

-- Remove the overly broad default privileges for service_role on profiles
REVOKE ALL ON public.profiles FROM service_role;

-- Grant only the minimum necessary privileges with proper policies

-- Policy: Service role can read profiles for system operations (notifications, etc.)
-- but only for specific system operations, not arbitrary access

  -- 1. It's for notification purposes (checking if user exists)
  -- 2. It's for account linking operations
  -- 3. It's for other legitimate system operations
  -- We'll use a function to validate the context
